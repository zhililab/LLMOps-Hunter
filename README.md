# LLMOps-Hunter

This repository contains a lightweight demonstration of LLMOps concepts using a
toy retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) evaluation.  The goal is to provide
a reproducible example for running an evaluation pipeline, producing reports,
and integrating with continuous integration (CI) workflows.

## Structure

- `code/llmops_trend_demo.py` – a standalone Python script that runs a toy RAG
  evaluation.  It reads a small in‑memory corpus, answers a set of questions
  using simple heuristics, and measures groundedness, latency and cost.
- `reports/` – this directory is created when the demo script runs.  Each
  execution writes a markdown report with a filename of the form
  `<date>-ragops-eval.md` containing summary statistics and detailed results.

## Running the demo

To run the evaluation, execute the script from the project root:

```sh
python code/llmops_trend_demo.py
```

This will create a report in the `reports/` directory.  The script requires
only the Python standard library and should run on any modern Python 3
interpreter.

## Integrating with CI

In a production environment, you would replace the toy retrieval and heuristic
answer generation with calls to real vector databases and language models.
The evaluation metrics could be extended to include factual accuracy,
toxicity, and cost tracking based on actual API usage.  The resulting
markdown report can be uploaded as a build artifact, emailed to stakeholders,
or displayed in dashboards.
