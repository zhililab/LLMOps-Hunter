# Weekly LLMOps Report – 2025-08-11

## Highlights

- Generated a fresh **RAGOps evaluation** for 2025‑08‑11 using the toy demo script.
- Measured **groundedness**, **latency** and **cost** for each query.
- Average groundedness was **0.939**, average latency **72.0 ms** and average cost **0.000073 USD** per response.

## Historical Comparison

This is the first recorded run in the `reports` directory, so there is no history to compare yet.

## Notes

- The evaluation uses a tiny in‑memory corpus and simple heuristics for answering questions.  In a production
  environment you would connect to a vector database, call a real LLM, and compute additional metrics such
  as factual accuracy, toxicity, and cost based on API usage.
- The script writes a detailed report to `reports/2025-08-11-ragops-eval.md` with per‑query metrics.

## Personalized Advice

- Integrate this demo into your CI/CD pipeline.  For example, run `python code/llmops_trend_demo.py` as part of
  pull‑request checks and publish the generated report as a build artifact.
- Export the metrics (groundedness, latency, cost) to your monitoring stack (e.g., ELK/Grafana) and set up alerts
  when groundedness drops or latency spikes.
- As you transition to real workloads, adopt selective routing (using smaller models for simple tasks and larger
  models only when necessary) and caching to manage inference costs.
